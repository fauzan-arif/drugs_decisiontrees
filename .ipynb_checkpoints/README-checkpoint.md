This Project is based on kaggle data set below is the link 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pablomgomez21/drugs-a-b-c-x-y-for-decision-trees/data

Main purpose is to understand the decision trees by practical application. 
I have used both entropy and gini metric to predict the classification target variable. 

For envriornment I have used Poetry as env and dependencies management tool. 
If you want to run the project or notebook on local machine , you can do so by creating a temp protery enviornment using <poetry shell> in the terminal 
After the shell has beeen created you can run it on jupyter lab 

Main notebook is http://localhost:8889/lab/workspaces/auto-t/tree/drugs_classification.ipynb
